# 🧾 Multilayer Digital Forensics  
### QA testing • Accessibility diagnostics • Systemic audits • Institutional case studies  
**by Luz Werner**

**Interdisciplinary digital forensics: QA testing, accessibility diagnostics, systemic audits, and real institutional case studies.**

This repository brings together projects, experiments, audits, and real-world investigations documented using the **Multilayer Digital Forensics Framework (Perito Multicapa)** — a hybrid method that integrates:

- QA testing and manual inspection  
- Critical auditing of digital platforms and workflows  
- Institutional forensics and discourse analysis  
- Accessibility diagnostics (WCAG 2.1/2.2)  
- Error Lab explorations (system failures, glitches, breakdowns)  
- Political and systemic analysis of digital environments  
- Forensic traceability and evidence-based documentation  

The goal is to build a **technical-critical archive** that can be used for portfolio work, consulting, research, institutional audits, and professional development.

## 🧩 Multilayer Digital Forensics — Method Overview

This methodology integrates eight analytical layers:

1. **Linguistic Layer**  
2. **Psychological (non-clinical) Layer**  
3. **Narrative Layer**  
4. **Symbolic Layer**  
5. **Political & Power Layer**  
6. **Algorithmic Layer**  
7. **Forensic Layer**  
8. **Operational Layer**

Its purpose is to cross technical evaluation, discourse analysis, systemic patterns, institutional responsibility, and user impact — creating a comprehensive forensic view of how systems behave and fail.
